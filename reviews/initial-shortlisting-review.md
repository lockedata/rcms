Following a high-level review of the available CMSs, here are our findings:

|               | Conf Page | Call for Papers | Tickets | Agenda | Users | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **OCS** | Old, unsupported, requires server installation, not visually customisable, looks like a Win 95 app | N | Y | Y | Y | N | 
| **Indico** | Demo failed badly, very hard to access, *assumed (couldn't access in demo), **Uses Cern central login, extremely hard to use and unstable | Y | Y | Y | Y* | Y** | 
| **Frab** | Barebones, still in beta (5 years+), ticketing only via external services | Y | Y | N | Y | Y |
| **OSEM** | Fully customisable, single page website design, very modern, fully open (via GitHub), web based (css, yml, md, html), easy to use | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| **Odoo (Events)** | Big ERP open source solution, easy setup, self-contained service, professional and modern appearance, full site design, web access, has a SAAS version but we can get a community edition using our own server. Has blog, chat, spreadsheet, event management, e-commerce, POS service (so very powerful!)  | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| **OCW** | Heavy duty, low documentation, depends on Ruby on Rails, additional features such as external account login (i.e. Facebook),  less customisable, more toggleable| Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |


Following this, immediate thoughts are that of the best options, OSEM is the simplest while still being very flexible, OpenConferenceWare is a good mid-level service, but Odoo is the most powerful option, providing us with everything we might need.
